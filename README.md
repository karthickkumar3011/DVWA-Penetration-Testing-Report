# DVWA-Penetration-Testing-Report
This repository contains my DVWA Penetration Testing Project (Medium Security Level). The project focuses on identifying, exploiting, and documenting common web application vulnerabilities using Damn Vulnerable Web Application (DVWA), an intentionally insecure platform for cybersecurity practice.

The report includes detailed analysis and exploitation of:

Brute Force

SQL Injection

Command Injection

File Upload (RCE)

Reflected XSS

Stored XSS

Each vulnerability is documented with methodology, payloads used, findings, screenshots, risk ratings, and remediation recommendations based on industry standards.

This project demonstrates hands-on experience in ethical hacking, VAPT techniques, and professional report writing using tools such as Kali Linux, Burp Suite, Nmap, and browser developer tools. It showcases practical skills in identifying security flaws, assessing impact, and proposing effective security measures.
