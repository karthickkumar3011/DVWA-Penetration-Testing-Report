# DVWA-Penetration-Testing-Report
This repository contains my DVWA Penetration Testing Report (Medium Security Level). It includes exploitation of Brute Force, SQL Injection, Command Injection, File Upload RCE, Reflected XSS, and Stored XSS. The project demonstrates practical VAPT skills using Kali Linux and Burp Suite, with clear findings, impact analysis, and remediation steps.
